Hacker News上看到的一篇<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7242265">文章</a>，觉得非常难以理解，花了一下午和一晚上的时间逐句翻译，总算是明白了。这篇文章有两个阻碍理解的地方，一是文章结构巧妙，文章虽名为讲YC，但开头前三段一直在讲笔记本，让人犯糊涂，中间才讲YC，最后又以笔记本收尾，这时才明白作者的写作构思，觉得巧妙。二是很多句子都使用了复杂的修饰，如“Naturally, those notes turned out to be nothing but the wild swirling caricatures of a sleep-deprived procrastinator nodding off every few minutes as the professor droned on.”我翻译为了“自然地，这些笔记最终成为了一个在教授的课堂上每隔几分钟都要点头打盹的缺乏睡眠的拖延者手中的狂野的让人眩晕的漫画册。”等。全文翻译如下。

#Why I Dropped Out Of YC
#为什么我退出YC

I bought my first Moleskine by sheer coincidence while shopping for craft supplies that a design course had required; I had avoided buying a notebook for the first two years at university by resourcefully (for which some might argue was born out of necessity from the lazy frugality of your average college kid) removing stacks of printer paper from the student center under a well-rehearsed, convincing ruse that I was somehow heroically fixing a “paper jam”.

我买下我的第一个Moleskine笔记本完全是出于巧合，当时我正在购买设计课上需要的手工制作材料。在上大学的前两年里我免去了买笔记本，我用了一个排练好的并且让人信服的诡计，在好像我在很英勇的维修打印机“卡纸”故障的假象中聪明的（对有些人来说这可能是出于普遍的大学生的懒惰和节俭）拿走了学生中心处打印机旁边堆叠的打印纸来代替笔记本。

By my third year I was making enough money from being a resident advisor and scrapping by with a delightful hodgepodge of research jobs that I could finally renounce my thieving ways and afford some decent stationeries, one of which was a proper notebook on which I could keep notes. I’m going to be taking actual notes in an actual notebook like a Shakespearean boss, I thought as I browsed the notebook section in the art supplies store. I picked the most conventional looking one from the pile: a large Moleskine Classic Notebook with a hard cover and plain, white pages. I knew not what a Moleskine was then or of its more hipster connotations (I swear) or why it cost an arm and leg for one, but I was pleased to have something I could, at long last, take notes on that’s not single sheet and A4-sized.

到了大学第三年，我那时正在当宿舍管理员并且忙碌于一份愉快而又冗杂的研究工作，这让我终于结束了偷窃之路，能够有钱购买一些正经文具了，其中之一文具便是一个可以记录笔记的合适的笔记本。当我在一个艺术品商店里浏览笔记本区的时候，我想我将会像“莎士比亚的老板”一样在一个真正的笔记本上记录真正的笔记。我从笔记本堆里选了一本样式最为传统的笔记本：一个大号的Moleskine经典笔记本，硬质封面，以及空白的白色内页。当时我还不知道Moleskine，以及它代表的是更时髦的含义（我发誓），也不知道为什么它价格不菲，但我很开心的是我将会在很长时间内不再在单页的A4大小的纸上面做笔记了。

Naturally, those notes turned out to be nothing but the wild swirling caricatures of a sleep-deprived procrastinator nodding off every few minutes as the professor droned on. But over time that first Moleskine served as an outlet for my creative self, a blank canvas I painted with my thoughts and ideas and dreams. It captured the moments of blinding clarity and paroxysms of fleeting epiphany that so often defined checkpoints of my personal growth. More importantly, the notebook embodied me at my best and dutifully provided a record from which I could reflect and study.

逐渐地，这些笔记最终成为了一个在教授的课堂上每隔几分钟都要点头打盹的缺乏睡眠的拖延者手中的狂野的让人眩晕的漫画册。但是随着时间的推移，这第一个Moleskine笔记本成为了我释放创造性自我的出口，以及我绘制思想、创意和梦想的空白画布。它捕捉了炫目当中的清晰瞬间，以及突如其来的转瞬即逝的且经常是定义我个人成长关键点的顿悟瞬间。更重要的是，这个笔记本呈现了我最好的时刻，并且提供了可以供我反省和学习的忠实记录。

I filled up that very same Moleskine at the end of last year, around the time when I decided to join the startup as she made the transition to the Bay Area after being accepted into Y Combinator. The fortuitous signs of a full notebook greeting a new opportunity in a new year got the best of my superstitious tendencies, so I ordered a brand-spanking new one off Amazon. In the five or so weeks since Y Combinator commenced in full swing, I haven’t written anything in the Moleskine. In fact, it’s still sitting on my shelf, wrapped in its original packaging.

去年年底我写完了这个Moleskine笔记本，当时正是我决定加入这家被YC接收然后移师硅谷的创业公司的时候。在新的一年里一个写满的笔记本迎接一个新的机会，这种巧合勾起了我的迷信倾向，于是我在亚马逊订了一个全新的笔记本。在加入YC满负荷运转后的大约五个星期时间里，我一行笔记也没有写下。事实上笔记本依然在我的书架上，包裹在原始的包装中。

Earlier this week we met with our advisor and YC partner Aaron over what seemed to be a divergence in the direction of the company and the underlying disagreement on how to best solve problems. In the hour we talked, what surfaced instead was an irreconcilable working relationship rooted in fundamental differences in personalities and misaligned expectations of roles and responsibilities. There were no hard feelings, just hard lessons learned.

这个星期早些时候我们会见了我们的导师兼YC合伙人Aaron，讨论公司发展方向上的分歧和潜在的关于怎么最好的解决问题的分歧。在我们谈话的过程中，呈现出来的问题却是双方源自于个性上本质的不同所带来的矛盾的工作关系，以及对于职责和责任的期望的不一致。谈话本身并不难受，只是感觉上了一堂很难懂的课。

Maybe I signed up for the wrong thing or for the wrong reason, as well-intentioned as I was from the start. Maybe it was more about Y Combinator, the subject of numerous pages in my Moleskine, and that was wrong. Maybe in the wake of a failed startup I deluded myself into thinking great teams are predicated on great friendships, a truism that no longer holds absolute truth.

也许我是在为一个错误的理由做一个错误的事情，虽然从一开始我就带着良好的愿景。也许选择在我的笔记本中占据大量篇幅的YC是个错误。也许我在一个失败的创业中的清醒时刻欺骗了自己去认同伟大的创业公司只是建立在伟大的友谊之上，这个众所周知的不是绝对的真理。

It was also the acceptance that the startup would never be something I could call my own, not just in stake but in equal say, that cemented my decision to walk away. A sense of ownership can be a powerful motivator for a startup; in this case the lack thereof tore it apart. But if you asked me for the one reason why it didn’t work out, the truth is that it just wasn’t fun anymore, and when you’re grinding away on an early stage venture with no pay, the enjoyment you derive from working with your partners is all you have.

还有一个需要接受的事实就是这个创业公司将不再是我自己所说的那个创业公司，不仅在股权方面而且在平等发言权方面，这坚定了我离开的决定。拥有感是创业公司的强大动力，这一点已经没有了。但是如果你问我为什么离开的唯一原因，事实上是它不再有趣，当你没有报酬的参与到一个早期的创业公司当中，你所得到的全部收获是你与同伴们一起工作时的快乐。

Egos clashed and convictions shaken, we came to the consesnsus that it’d be best if I part ways with the startup. To some extent I was relieved, freed from an incompatible environment that brought no party joy, and it hardly mattered that, to those like me who held the institution on a pedestal, this is Y Combinator we’re talking about. Aaron put it this way, “Stop thinking about YC. YC is an artificial construct, a forcing function that augments a startup’s chances to succeed. But if you can’t work together, then none of it matters. If someone tells me I can do YC but I’ll have to wear hot pants the whole time, I wouldn’t do it.” And I wholeheartedly agree with him: life’s too short to wear hot pants.

自我内心的冲突和自信心的动摇，我们的一致意见是如果我离开这个创业公司将是最好的选择。某种程度上我是解放了，从一个不融洽的环境中自由出来了，这个环境不能带来开派对般的快乐，也不在乎有这种快乐，给像我这种基于快乐建立制度的人，这个环境就是我们正在谈论的YC。Aaron是这样说的，“停止思考YC是什么，YC是一个人造的概念，是一个强制提高创业成功机会的函数。但是如果你们不能一起工作，那双方都无所谓。如果有人告诉我我能在YC工作但是我必须要一直穿着短裤，我将不干。”我完全同意他的说法：生命太短以至于穿不上短裤。

It’s been a few days since my departure, and I’m as uncertain as ever regarding my next steps, largely given that I’m still digesting what I’ve learned from this experience, and partly because I’ve grown jaded and disillusioned with Silicon Valley at large. What’s certain is that I won’t be touching startups for a very long time, and I might even stay away from Hacker News for a while. If anything, when the time comes and that startup itch manifests itself again, I’ve taken to heart that it will be of my own creation, with a team I can entrust equal ownership, and on my own terms, Y Combinator or not.

我离开已经有几天了，我像从前一样在犹豫不决的考虑着下一步，主要考虑到我仍然在消化这次学习到的经验，还有部分原因是因为我已经对硅谷感到厌倦和大失所望。可以确定的是我将在很长一段时内不再碰创业公司，并且我甚至可能离开Hacker News一段时间。如果可能，当时机到来并且那家创业公司渴望再次证明自己，我将会把这几点铭记在心：它将包含我自己的创造，有一个我能委托平等的所有权的团队，以及遵循我自己而不是YC的条款。

Taking the new Moleskine from the shelf and removing it from its plastic wrap, I turned to the first blank page and picked up my pen.

从书架上拿下新的Moleskine笔记本，除去它的塑料包装，我翻开到第一个空白页并拿起了我的笔。

Here we go again.

我们再一次从这里出发。
